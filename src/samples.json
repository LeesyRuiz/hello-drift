I don't remember my twitter logins so I post it here. I'M GUTTED, horrible to be in this situation. There is nothing more I dislike than ignorant and negative posts about gender roles in music. My deepest apologies to Maya, my fans, and the entire LGBTQQ community on behalf of my label for my partners inappropriate comments. The person working for me has now been removed from the label and relieved of his duties, including social media. Those who know me can assure that I do not hate on other artists. Unfortunately, due to the timing of this incident, we feel it necessary to reschedule the tour, only because we would like to come back and make a more concerted effort to transgender organizations and artist to be included for the make up date. Embarrassing enough my label has trans-gender artist on board and I would never want to hurt any of my friends. We will continue to support artists with no discrimination, and will NOT CONDONE the actions of those who do not exude compassion, empathy, and understanding for all.\" Sincerely Bjarki R.

Founded in 2013, the group includes lead singer and guitarist Alex Cohen, guitarist Adrian Sebastian Haynes, bassist Tomás Garcia-olano, and drummer Andrew Stevens. \n\nIn 2014, the band released their debut album, This Is Not A Bedroom, on Punctum Records. With a guitar-focused sound, this first release reflects nostalgia for early romance and self-discovery, drawing from collective conversations about youth and its limitations. As an expansion of the themes found in Bedroom, Alex Napping released Trembles Part I & II in 2016, a pair of expressive singles hinging on a short story composed by Cohen. Trembles caught the ear of both NPR and BBC Radio 1, earning featured spots on their respective SXSW coverage. Mise En Place, the band's upcoming sophomore full-length, weaves together the uncertainty of adulthood with a personal desire to establish existential structure. It also marks the band's first release with San Francisco-based Father/Daughter Records. Revolving around a formative relationship, this album tells the story of Cohen's conflicting roles as both person and partner while highlighting a sophisticated, dimensional sound from the band at large. In Mise En Place, arrangements take center stage, overwhelming the guitar-centric sound that had dominated their early releases. This new band dynamic comes together articulately in the album's lead single, Living Room. Moody and honest, with tracks that express both joy and isolation, Mise En Place explores the struggle to evade traditionalism, define personal success, and balance the expectations of love. \n\nMise En Place comes out on Father/Daughter Records on May 5th, 2017. You can find the band somewhere between Austin and New York City.\n\nw/ \nHoop + Goat Reward","distance":"67","startTime":"2017-08-08T20:00:00-0700","endTime":null,"timeFromNow":1371355,"category":"MUSIC_EVENT","stats":{"attending":25,"declined":0,"maybe":80,"noreply":130},"venue":{"id":"1712524898989073","name":"Timbre Room","about":"Downtown Seattle nightclub.","emails":["info@timbreroom.com"],"coverPicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/q90/s720x720/16113177_1817984115109817_4560918539100580940_o.jpg?oh=b632b1cc9e61888e91567bfa66adcc66&oe=5A032428","profilePicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c29.0.200.200/p200x200/13245231_1712527172322179_8128943739059352113_n.png?oh=bb17c90e6d80abe407b90c9de3b5eac9&oe=59F610CD","category":"Dance & Night Club","categoryList":["Dance & Night Club"],"location":{"city":"Seattle","country":"United States","latitude":47.61688,"longitude":-122.33113,"state":"WA","street":"1809 Minor Ave.","zip":"98101"}}},{"id":"1019768641491172","name":"Marina Albero Project","type":"public","coverPicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/20017471_1383601801695481_8603883442340972325_o.jpg?oh=719ff5ec8d97762c94acf9b4fe24682c&oe=5A394650","profilePicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c122.0.200.200/p200x200/19884453_1383601801695481_8603883442340972325_n.jpg?oh=14ceae177a23118d0445b01969a4a74c&oe=59F4BA9F","description":"Quintet!!

All our shows at Tula's thus far have sold out, so make your reservations early!\n\nWww.theginjointsband.com\n\n\"Born out of a love of the early years of swing, country and rock 'n 'roll, Birch Pereira & the Gin Joints is a band whose sound transports you to the time of speakeasies, honky-tonks and roadhouses. With upright bassist and vocalist Birch Pereira at its center, the band features many of Seattle's most skilled and versatile musicians who share the love of the American song traditions and a desire to offer a fresh angle on them.\n\nThe band's debut album, Dream Man, was released independently and received the Earshot Jazz Golden Ear Award for Northwest Recording of the year in 2016. Fans, critics and deejays have delighted in Birch Pereira's \"old soul,\" tenor voice, the group's clean stripped-down arrangements of musical gems from the past and Pereira's ever growing repertoire of original, yet period evoking material. The musicians assembled on record and for live performance stand out both for their obvious skill and for the obvious passion that all of the contributing players have for each of these great musical eras. The skill and passion result in performances that act like aural time traveling experiences.","distance":"1030","startTime":"2017-08-11T19:30:00-0700","endTime":"2017-08-11T22:00:00-0700","timeFromNow":1628755,"category":"EVENT_ART","stats":{"attending":1,"declined":0,"maybe":18,"noreply":89},"venue":{"id":"139777929395094","name":"Tula's Restaurant & Jazz Club","about":"Jazz Club and Restaurant.

He has releases on Dirtybird, Perfect Driver, Club Sweat and more and we couldn't be more excited to have him headline our first ever day party. \n\nWood Holly began with electronic music and hip hop at the young age of 12. Inspired by several sub genres in bass music, WoodHolly brings a unique sound, blending heavy 808 drums,various instruments, and raw hip hop vocal cuts. This is one of those chances to see an artist before they blow up....a \"remember when we saw him at....\" moment. We'll be bringing our signature Noise Complaint vibes to the Monkey Loft deck, so let's show them how we get down!\n\nLOCAL SUPPORT FROM:\nSubset\nSwoon(ish)  - Jason Woo b2b Soon(ish)\n\n\n[MONKEY LOFT STAGE]\n\nPOSTMATTS & FRIENDS FEATURING:\nPostmatts (Streeter b2b Pressha)\nThe Hot Sauce Committee (T.H.S.C.)\nBacosaurus\n------------------------------------------------\n\n$15 tickets available day of show, $5 off with presale ticket from Noise Complaint's 1st Birthday Party!

As Electronic Dance Music has exploded in popularity over the last several years, so have crowds and ticket prices along with it. In the beginning, events were held in underground, often intimate venues. It was about the music, and it was about each other. \n\nNoise Complaint is taking it back to its roots. We're bringing in huge talent - DJs and producers that are well known and respected but that we also personally vibe with. We're doing this at a small price, and in an intimate space. It's about the music for us, it's about the party and the vibe and the memories and friends you will make. Every Noise Complaint should be the best party you've been to since well, the last Noise Complaint. \n\nWe're more than just a party, we're a movement.","distance":"67","startTime":"2017-08-13T14:00:00-0700","endTime":"2017-08-13T18:00:00-0700","timeFromNow":1781755,"category":"EVENT_PARTY","stats":{"attending":120,"declined":0,"maybe":236,"noreply":1555},"venue":{"id":"1125928777445757","name":"Noise Complaint","about":"Noise Complaint is more than just a party, it's a movement.

I was able to perfectly recreate pictures. At school you’d have projects for the term and we were looking at Sikhism. I think I was about seven. I was asked to create this massive mural of Guru Nanak using different forms – using sequences, dipped painted cotton wool, Sikh fabrics.” He pauses as he thinks it through. “I ended up applying that to music. I create sketches, essentially like these fabrics, and I collage them together…once I see the picture it’s embellished further and the proceeds repeats.”\nIf his first obsession was drawing, his first love was football. Indeed, if it wasn’t for a career-ending injury while a promising young player with West Bromwich Albion, football may well have remained his abiding obsession. Luckily for music, the injury caused a sudden change in direction. “I got some turntables and taught myself how to DJ, built up a small record collection and then started to DJ at student house parties in Wolverhampton.”\nA devotee of Detroit techno and particularly, Derrick May, Carl Craig and Kevin Saunderson, Cunningham had no real sense how far outside the mainstream he stood. Luckily he met Matthew Parsons, who not only knew what he was playing, but had a basic studio set up in his student digs. ‘Creating music was a bit of a black art,’ Cunningham remembers. “There was a curtain and I couldn’t see how it was made on the other side.” Parsons not only let him in and showed him the basics, when he went travelling he sold him all his kit for 200 quid.\nSoon after, Darren moved to London. The PFA (Professional Footballers Association) was running a grant programme for young players whose careers had been finished by injury and as a result, they funded his place on one of the first degree courses in Recording Arts. Which was when the partying started. “I was clean living before this point. Total fitness. I had periods where I didn’t make music at all as I didn’t have the money. I ended up buying synthesisers instead of paying tuition fees.” The result of this was a complete submersion in the dance subcultures of the capital city as well as a crash course in production. “I just got stuck in, from a practical, experimental viewpoint. Never used a metronome. That’s how my style developed.”\nThe result of all this wasn’t just the birth of Actress but of Werkdiscs, originally a club night with some friends, which became a label in time for the first Actress release in 2004. The label went on to discover and release some of the most widely talked-about artists of the emerging bass generation, namely Lukid, Disrupt and Zomby. As well as running the label, Actress remixed Various Productions, wrote for the seminal techno imprint Soma Records, put out singles and EPs through Prime Numbers and Nonplus and released the 'Splazsh’ and 'R.I.P' albums on Honest Jons, the British independent record label jointly created and founded by Damon Albarn. He also travelled with Albarn to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to record ‘Kinshasa One Two,’ which was released by Warp in 2011.\nOne of the preeminent and most singular voices in UK electronic music, since 2012 he has run his label in conjunction with Ninja Tune, releasing ‘Ghettoville’ in 2014, a record described as “inscrutable, unsettling and utterly unique” (Uncut). An epilogue poem written for the press release to Ghettoville led people to believe that Cunningham had retired. This in turn led him to conceptualize his new work as ‘Giving power back to identity.’\nNow he returns with a new album and a new music system – “AZD” (pronounced “Azid”). An artist who has always preferred to make music than to talk about it, in “AZD” he has achieved another remarkable landmark, one which is as resistant to interpretation as it is demanding of it.\nIn addition to his recorded work, Actress has been photographed by Wolfgang Tillmans, and the late celebrated photographer Lord Snowden.  He has worked collaboratively on projects with White Cube artist Eddie Peake, Mehdi Lacoste, Dan Emmerson and Belgian visual artist Pierre Debusschere, as well as fronting campaigns for Fashion brands Acne and Cav Empt, during which he has performed sell out shows at The Barbican Center and Tate Modern London, Sonar Tokyo and Berghain Berlin.\nCunningham is currently preparing a new live show, to be debuted at Convergence Village Underground on March 24th. Presented as AZD, Cunningham says it “will be a test frame for linking circuits using various forms of language — Midi globalised language, Lyrical language, Tikal Graffiti code and various other Synthesiser language — to create one intelligent musical instrument called AZD, if successful it will produce the first translucent, non-soluble communication sound pill synergised through impressionistic interpretations of technological equipment. This is the music vitamin of the Metropolis.”\nIt’s an album which logically sums complexity with elegance, and diverts non logical linguistic tanks through the dispersion and subversion of ghetto gothic cut up technology.\nDescribed by Cunningham as “Non dance based civilian mind groove, mapped to an external soul beyond the collapsing black hole…Music is chaos R.I.P Music”\n\nABOUT RAICA\nThe cavernous and beautiful project of renowned DJ and Further Records headmaster Chloe Harris, Raica walks a fine line between lucid animation and blurred darkness.\n“Originally released as a tape in 2012, Dosemarked a difficult transition for Chloe Harris, the Seattle-based producer and co-head of Further Records. Before she made experimental synth music as Raica, Harris toured the world as a progressive house DJ and close associate of John Digweed, an artist who couldn’t be further removed from the music on Dose. Harris says the tape (now a record) was the sound of her trying to claw her way out of that world, or at least find a new one. Looking back on it now, Dose is a stunning document of vulnerability and volatile inspiration couched in seriously experimental, mind-bending music.” – Resident Advisor on Dose (2012)","distance":"63","startTime":"2017-08-23T21:00:00-0700","endTime":"2017-08-24T01:00:00-0700","timeFromNow":2670955,"category":"PARTIES_NIGHTLIFE","stats":{"attending":167,"declined":0,"maybe":323,"noreply":303},"venue":{"id":"198657196962661","name":"Kremwerk","about":"US Nightclub, promotion and entertainment booking specializing in electronic music and queer culture, full bar and private event bookings available.","emails":["info@kremwerk.com"],"coverPicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/20045719_757988921029483_8642295343994233163_o.png?oh=7c5ec59469096c414910bda9f023847f&oe=59FA95C4","profilePicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/13754565_578064332355277_8326917205147933653_n.png?oh=3ed24a7240d7d6b07997aa3080593690&oe=5A0013D1","category":"Dance & Night Club","categoryList":["Dance & Night Club","Lounge"],"location":{"city":"Seattle","country":"United States","latitude":47.616871,"longitude":-122.331184,"state":"WA","street":"1809 Minor Ave","zip":"98101"}}},{"id":"635876349956003","name":"Annie Hart @ The Timbre Room at The Timbre Room","type":"public","coverPicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/19894918_10159314436325227_2815029742672359092_n.png?oh=bcddf9e369313c6efbd5f4a5077d182e&oe=5A063148","profilePicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c49.0.200.200/p200x200/19894918_10159314436325227_2815029742672359092_n.png?oh=66c5d41dcb5c031e509125b35f35fb53&oe=5A04C5D3","description":"Annie Hart @ The Timbre Room at The Timbre Room","distance":"67","startTime":"2017-10-20T19:00:00-0700","endTime":null,"timeFromNow":7674955,"category":"MUSIC_EVENT","stats":{"attending":0,"declined":0,"maybe":5,"noreply":0},"venue":{"id":"1712524898989073","name":"Timbre Room","about":"Downtown Seattle nightclub.","emails":["info@timbreroom.com"],"coverPicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/q90/s720x720/16113177_1817984115109817_4560918539100580940_o.jpg?oh=b632b1cc9e61888e91567bfa66adcc66&oe=5A032428","profilePicture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/c29.0.200.200/p200x200/13245231_1712527172322179_8128943739059352113_n.png?oh=bb17c90e6d80abe407b90c9de3b5eac9&oe=59F610CD","category":"Dance & Night Club","categoryList":["Dance & Night Club"],"location":{"city":"Seattle","country":"United States","latitude":47.61688,"longitude":-122.33113,"state":"WA","street":"1809 Minor Ave.","zip":"98101"}}}],"metadata":{"venues":28,"venuesWithEvents":6,"events":42}}
